# What is a Project Report?

A **project report** is a document offering a comprehensive overview of a projectâ€™s objectives, progress, team performance, and milestone accomplishments. It also gives an account of the challenges faced during a projectâ€™s execution, solutions devised to tackle them, and the lessons learned during the process.

Project managers create these reports to communicate with other project stakeholdersâ€”including team members, sponsors, clients, and other interested partiesâ€”to ensure everyoneâ€™s on the same page. The document also serves as a foundation for further evaluation and analysis to ensure the project stays on track and achieves its goals. ðŸŽ¯
